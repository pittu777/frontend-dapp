Ethereum Smart Contract Interaction Web Application

This project demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using a web application built with React. Users can deposit Ether into the contract and update a greeting message stored on the blockchain. The web application provides a user-friendly interface to perform these actions and displays the current contract balance and greeting message. This project serves as a practical example for developers learning about blockchain integration with web applications.

Description
This project is a simple web application built with React that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract, written in Solidity, allows users to deposit Ether and set a greeting message, which is stored on the blockchain. The web application displays the current greeting and the contract balance in Ether, providing a seamless interface for users to interact with the blockchain.
